# Advice Generator Challenge ðŸ’¡

 - Welcome and thanks for visualizing my work. I hope you like it. 
This project was inspired by the FrontEnd Mentor Website. You can find it [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db); 
## Layout
- This was the layout I got inspired by when doing this project. Of Course I changed, but I tried to keep the sintaxe and the measures. 

    - Desktop layout

    - Mobile layout

## Tools
- To finish this project to this day (31/08/2023), I took two to three days to create the HTML, add styles with CSS, get it responsive with media queries, add images, create a README and upload on GitHub, using GIT(cause I'm practicing that too ðŸ¤©) 
- I used VS CODE.

## Yet to do

- JavaScript interactive tools.
